							<h4>Overview</h4>
							<p>BankTEL sees a unique opportunity to move the existing BankTEL Financial Suite to a cloud
							based environment based entirely on a recurring revenue module. While leveraging BankTEL's
							existing products and expertise, additional modules will be developed and added to the
							suite. These include modules for General Ledger, Financial Reporting, AR, Invoicing, and
							Payroll/HR.
							<br><br>
							A new company will be formed to merge and develop these new modules along with marketing
							and support. This new product mix would be called theBIZ. The unique marketing plan
							will be to market the new products through BankTEL’s existing financial institution clients to
							their small business customers.

							<p>The new company’s applications will be delivered via a true multitenant,
							cloud based suite of accounting software functionality that will monetize based on a monthly recurring model.
							BankTEL has moved to that model, aggressively, over the last 10 years with good success.
							An access point for theBIZ will be added to the financial institutions website for their business
							customers to access and utilize theBIZ. The new product will be sold on a recurring, monthly
							subscription basis and compete with QuickBooks and other like competitors in the marketplace.<br><br>
							Several key advantages are available to the financial institution and the business customers for
							this new product. This new accounting system’s functionality will be integrated tightly into the
							banks bill pay system along with integration into any mobile offering the bank may have. No
							other accounting system in the marketplace will have a more seamless integration to their
							customer’s bank’s systems.<br><br>
							Another key differentiation will be that theBIZ will be designed and built, from the ground up,
							to take advantage of and leverage the high growth mobile device adoption currently underway
							in the U.S. today. There are no complete accounting systems today that are truly built from the
							ground up for mobile. This will be a unique offering and give the bank an attractive advance in
							the marketplace.</p>
